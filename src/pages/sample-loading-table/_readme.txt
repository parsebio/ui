You should be able to view the sample loading table by viewing sample-loading-table.html.

sample-loading-table.html is the output from the .php file (the functionality provided by php here could be picked up by javascript if desired).

In "dependencies":
saphire.css (CSS library for things like padding, placement, alignment, etc...)
saphire-js.js  (A small javascript library for common things)
text-accordion.js/css  (used for the hidden "accordion" sections when the user has submitted the necessary data)
saphire-icons.css/ttf/woff   (font icons)

In "website-css"
The two files just bring in some of the formatting from the website.
